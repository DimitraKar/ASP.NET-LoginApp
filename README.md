# LoginApp

This is an ASP.NET example for register and login users from database and it runs on localhost.

The homepage is for user register and when the user registers he has to click the login button on the menubar.

Then, there is a login page that checks if the user exists on database and if he's not then display the relevant message to login again. If the user exists on the database then redirects to the homepage with a welcome message with his name. 

If user tries to access homepage without login, then redirects to the login page.
